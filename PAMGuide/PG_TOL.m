%     Compute third octave levels (TOLs) of signal x sampled at fs Hz
%     using multi-rate processing.
%     The third octaves to compute are chosen automatically based on the
%     sampling rate and the key frequency (1kHz by default).
%
%     Return:
%     A is the TOLs in dB re pref for each T second averaging interval.
%        The first row of S is the TOLs for the first averaging interval etc.
%     fc is the center frequency of each third octave in Hz.
%     CI is the lower and upper confidence intervals in dB for each third
%        octave assuming a Gaussian input. The confidence limit is 90%.
%
%     Scaling:
%     The TOLs are scaled so that, if all the signal energy in x is within
%     the frequency range analysed, then sum(10.^(S/10)) == mean(x.^2), assuming a
%     single averaging block. There will be small differences due to the
%     startup condition of the filter but the results should be close.
%
%     Example:
%        x=randn(10000,1);                   % white noise
%        [S,fc,CI] = thirdoctlevs(x,96e3);   % TOL analysis on x
%        % the TOLs should increase by 3dB per octave.
%
%        x=sin(2*pi*1000/96e3*(1:10000)');   % a 1kHz sinewave
%        [S,fc,CI] = thirdoctlevs(x,96e3);   % TOL analysis on x
%        [mean(x.^2) sum(10.^(S/10))]        % compare powers - should both be 0.5
